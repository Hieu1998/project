    'This is one of the best tours that I have ever taken anywhere. They truly do whatever it takes for you to have an authentic Vietnamese experience and go out of the way for the best sites. You can feel the passion for the tunnels and the knowledge is definitely there. My guide, Daniel, was excellent and has an answer for any question. He really knows a lot about his country and culture. It shows that Daniel greatly enjoys sharing this knowledge with tourists. We went to a rice noodle factory, a rubber farm and of course the tunnels. All while enjoying drinks and food along the way. I never felt unsafe on the back of the motorcycle. Amazing experience. Thanks Daniel!' => 'This is one of the best tours that I have ever taken anywhere.
